        <p class="bigger-text italic-text header-text">January 10, 2023</p>
        <p>
          Happy New Year’s, everyone, and welcome to the third installment of my Outreachy internship blog posts.
          &nbsp;I keep
          mentioning this internship, and it’s about time that I explained what I’m actually doing here.
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.outreachy.org/" target="_blank" class="underline-text">Outreachy</a> is an organization
          that
          provides internships
          with open source and open science organizations. I’m not interning <i>with</i> them, as such. &nbsp;Rather,
          I’ve
          been placed into an internship with the <a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/" target="_blank"
            class="underline-text">Wikimedia
            Foundation</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone’s heard of Wikipedia, of course, but it’s just one of many <a
            href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/our-work/wikimedia-projects/#a1-reference" target="_blank"
            class="underline-text">free
            knowledge projects</a> hosted by the Foundation (albeit the most well-known one).&nbsp; Needless to say,
          it's a big place, in which I occupy a very tiny corner within a sub-project called Toolhub.
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="https://toolhub.wikimedia.org/" target="_blank" class="underline-text">Toolhub</a> is
          a catalog of software
          applications which interact with Wikimedia projects. &nbsp;We’re talking things like scripts, bots, and web
          and
          mobile applications. &nbsp;Essentially, a “tool” is a software application that can be used to improve a
          user’s
          experience when interacting with a Wikimedia project.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each tool has its own Wikimedia page, where users can find information, such as the tool’s description,
          software license, and the languages its interface has been translated into, as well as additional links, for
          instance to a GitHub repository or to developer documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In many cases, however, these pages
          aren’t very
          well fleshed out, and the tools lack documentation and other information that could make them easier to
          understand and use.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once a tool has been registered on Toolhub and its record created in the database, there are some pieces of
          information about it &mdash; such as its name and its author &mdash; that can’t be changed. &nbsp;But there
          are other
          pieces
          that can be added or edited.
        </p>

        <p>
          These make up what’s called the “annotation layer” in the database record and
          include such things as an associated icon, the type of tool (e.g., a bot or a web app), and links to
          documentation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Essentially, my task, along with fellow intern Hannah Njoroge and our mentors <a
            href="https://twitter.com/iamslavina" target="_blank" class="underline-text">Slavina</a> and <a
            href="https://twitter.com/laredoyin" target="_blank" class="underline-text">Damilare</a>, is to
          design and deploy a web app (Toolhunt) that searches Toolhub’s database, locates tools that are missing
          information in the annotation layer (which is just about all of them), and presents these gaps in the data as
          if they were challenges for the user to solve, e.g. &nbsp;“We’re missing a link to this tool’s repository.
          &nbsp;Can you
          find it?”
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, we’re trying to convince people to help us fill information holes, and in order to do
          that we need to make it as easy and rewarding as possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          The project was inspired by another tool, <a href="https://citationhunt.toolforge.org/en?id=66c67a94"
            target="_blank" class="underline-text">Citation Hunt</a>, which does a similar thing with Wikipedia
          articles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Have you ever
          been
          browsing Wikipedia and come across the tag “[citation needed]”? &nbsp;
          Citation Hunt displays the snippets of
          articles marked with this tag and invites the user to search for a reliable source and add it to Wikipedia.
          &nbsp;In
          order to encourage a little friendly competition, Citation Hunt tracks user contributions and presents this
          information in a leader-board.
        </p>

        <p>
          We’re doing the same with Toolhunt.&nbsp; in addition to the editing interface, the application will include a
          leader-board as well as dashboard where users can keep track of their personal contributions, the latest
          global contributions, and the overall state of the project.
        </p>

        <p>
          But maybe it’s easier to show than to tell. &nbsp;As part of the application process,
          candidates were asked to design a mock front-end for the project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the design isn’t going to be
          quite
          the same
          (Hannah’s design for the homepage was much less busy than mine), you can get a pretty good idea of what the
          final project is intended to do from my <a href="https://nbarnabee.github.io/outreachy/index.html"
            target="_blank" class="underline-text">
            preliminary
            work
          </a>. &nbsp;(And if you'd like to see the code behind it, here's <a
            href="https://github.com/nbarnabee/outreachy" target="_blank" class="underline-text">the repository</a>.)
        </p>

        <p>
          The application itself is still very much a work in progress, but feel free to check out our <a
            href="https://github.com/wikimedia/toolhunt-ui" target="_blank" class="underline-text">front-end
            repository</a>.</p>

        <p>Next time I’ll be going into more detail regarding the tech stack and some of the challenges we’ve faced
          during the first half of the internship period.
        </p>
